# Members Only

The aim of this project was to create a exclusive messaging platform where guests can view messages anonymously, while members are able to post messages and see which user posted the message. Admins are able to view the full details of a message and delete messages.

The project was created using Express.js with a MongoDB database. Multiple Express middleware was used, including The Passport.js Local Strategy for user authentication. User passwords are hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database. The frontend is created using EJS and styled with Tailwind CSS.
